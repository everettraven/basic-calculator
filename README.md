# basic-calculator
This is a basic calculator program written in Python by my wife. It was written as part of teaching her a few basic concepts of programming.

# Goal
The goal of this project is for my wife to program in Python a very basic calculator that reads in a operand and two numbers to perform the operand operation on from the command line.

The following operands will be supported:
- `add`
- `subtract`
- `multiply`
- `divide`

An example of running the program:
```
python calculator.py add 5 10
```
will result in an output of:
```
Result of adding 5 and 10: 15
```
